## What is HTTP
HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is a foundational protocol used for transmitting data on the World Wide Web. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should respond to various commands. Here's a detailed overview of HTTP:

### Key Concepts of HTTP

#### 1. **Request-Response Model**
HTTP operates based on a request-response model, where a client (usually a web browser) sends a request to a server, and the server sends back a response.

#### 2. **HTTP Methods**
These are actions that can be performed on resources. The most common methods include:
- **GET:** Retrieve data from the server (e.g., loading a webpage).
- **POST:** Send data to the server (e.g., submitting a form).
- **PUT:** Update existing data on the server.
- **DELETE:** Remove data from the server.
- **HEAD:** Retrieve only the headers of a response, not the body.
- **OPTIONS:** Describe the communication options for the target resource.
- **PATCH:** Apply partial modifications to a resource.

#### 3. **HTTP Status Codes**
Responses from the server include status codes to indicate the result of the request. Common status codes include:
- **200 OK:** The request was successful.
- **404 Not Found:** The requested resource was not found.
- **500 Internal Server Error:** The server encountered an error processing the request.
- **301 Moved Permanently:** The resource has been moved to a new URL.
- **401 Unauthorized:** Authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided.

#### 4. **Headers**
HTTP headers provide additional information about the request or response. They can include metadata such as:
- **Content-Type:** The type of data being sent (e.g., `text/html` for HTML documents).
- **Content-Length:** The length of the data being sent.
- **User-Agent:** Information about the client making the request.
- **Authorization:** Credentials for authenticating the request.

#### 5. **URIs and URLs**
- **Uniform Resource Identifier (URI):** A string that identifies a resource.
- **Uniform Resource Locator (URL):** A type of URI that specifies the location of a resource along with the protocol to use (e.g., `http://www.example.com`).

### How HTTP Works

1. **Client Sends Request:**
   - The client (e.g., a web browser) sends an HTTP request to the server. This includes the HTTP method, the URL, and any necessary headers or body data.

2. **Server Processes Request:**
   - The server receives the request, processes it (e.g., retrieves a file, processes data), and prepares an HTTP response.

3. **Server Sends Response:**
   - The server sends an HTTP response back to the client. This includes a status code, headers, and optionally a body with the requested content.

4. **Client Receives and Renders Response:**
   - The client receives the response, processes it (e.g., renders HTML, executes scripts), and displays the result to the user.

### HTTPS: Secure HTTP

- **HTTPS (HTTP Secure):** An extension of HTTP that uses SSL/TLS to encrypt data transmitted between the client and server, ensuring privacy and security.

### HTTP/1.1 vs. HTTP/2 vs. HTTP/3

- **HTTP/1.1:** The most widely used version, introducing persistent connections and chunked transfer encoding.
- **HTTP/2:** Improves performance with features like multiplexing, header compression, and server push.
- **HTTP/3:** Uses QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) instead of TCP, aiming for faster and more reliable connections.

### Summary

HTTP is a protocol that defines how messages are formatted and exchanged on the web. It operates based on a request-response model, using various methods and status codes to facilitate communication between clients and servers. With the advent of HTTPS and newer versions like HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, the protocol has evolved to provide better security, performance, and reliability for modern web applications.


## Http status codes

HTTP status codes are standardized codes that the server sends back to the client in response to an HTTP request. These codes help the client understand the outcome of their request. Here’s a breakdown of the main categories of HTTP status codes and some common examples within each category:

### 1xx: Informational
These codes indicate that the request was received and understood and that the server is continuing to process it.

- **100 Continue:** The server has received the request headers and the client should proceed to send the request body.
- **101 Switching Protocols:** The server is switching protocols as requested by the client (e.g., from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2).

### 2xx: Success
These codes indicate that the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.

- **200 OK:** The request was successful. The response body contains the requested resource.
- **201 Created:** The request was successful, and a new resource was created as a result.
- **202 Accepted:** The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing is not yet complete.
- **204 No Content:** The request was successful, but there is no content to send in the response.

### 3xx: Redirection
These codes indicate that further action is needed to complete the request, usually involving a redirect.

- **301 Moved Permanently:** The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.
- **302 Found:** The requested resource is temporarily located at a different URL.
- **303 See Other:** The response to the request can be found at another URL using a GET request.
- **304 Not Modified:** The resource has not been modified since the last request, so the client can use the cached version.

### 4xx: Client Error
These codes indicate that there was an error with the request made by the client.

- **400 Bad Request:** The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.
- **401 Unauthorized:** Authentication is required and has failed or has not been provided.
- **403 Forbidden:** The client does not have permission to access the requested resource.
- **404 Not Found:** The requested resource could not be found on the server.
- **405 Method Not Allowed:** The HTTP method used is not allowed for the requested resource.
- **409 Conflict:** The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource.

### 5xx: Server Error
These codes indicate that the server failed to fulfill a valid request.

- **500 Internal Server Error:** The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
- **501 Not Implemented:** The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.
- **502 Bad Gateway:** The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server.
- **503 Service Unavailable:** The server is currently unable to handle the request due to temporary overloading or maintenance.
- **504 Gateway Timeout:** The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not receive a timely response from the upstream server.

### Summary

HTTP status codes are an essential part of web communication, helping clients understand the outcome of their requests and take appropriate actions. They are grouped into five categories: informational, success, redirection, client error, and server error. Each status code provides specific information about the result of the HTTP request.


## HTTP Evolution

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) has evolved over time to improve performance, security, and efficiency. Here’s a comparison of HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3:

### HTTP/1.1
HTTP/1.1 is the most widely used version of HTTP and introduced several improvements over its predecessor, HTTP/1.0.

#### Key Features:
- **Persistent Connections:** Allows multiple requests and responses to be sent over a single TCP connection, reducing the overhead of establishing new connections.
- **Chunked Transfer Encoding:** Enables the server to start sending a response before knowing the total size, improving performance for dynamic content.
- **Additional Headers:** Added new headers such as `Host`, which allows multiple domains to be served from a single IP address.

#### Limitations:
- **Head-of-Line Blocking:** Requests are handled sequentially over a single connection, so a delay in one request can block subsequent requests.
- **Lack of Multiplexing:** Only one request can be sent per connection at a time, limiting efficiency.

### HTTP/2
HTTP/2 was designed to address the performance limitations of HTTP/1.1.

#### Key Features:
- **Binary Protocol:** Uses a binary framing layer instead of text, which is more efficient to parse.
- **Multiplexing:** Allows multiple requests and responses to be sent simultaneously over a single TCP connection, eliminating head-of-line blocking.
- **Header Compression:** Uses HPACK compression to reduce the size of headers, decreasing the amount of data transferred.
- **Server Push:** Enables servers to proactively send resources to the client that it anticipates the client will need, reducing latency.

#### Improvements:
- **Reduced Latency:** Multiplexing and header compression significantly improve page load times.
- **Better Resource Utilization:** Server push and prioritized request handling enhance overall performance.

### HTTP/3
HTTP/3 is the latest version of the protocol and represents a major shift by using QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) instead of TCP.

#### Key Features:
- **QUIC Protocol:** HTTP/3 runs on top of QUIC, a transport protocol that uses UDP instead of TCP. QUIC was designed to reduce latency and improve connection reliability.
- **Zero Round-Trip Time (0-RTT):** Allows the establishment of connections with no latency overhead for repeated connections, reducing the time needed to start data transfer.
- **Improved Multiplexing:** QUIC handles multiplexing at the transport layer, further eliminating head-of-line blocking that can occur even in HTTP/2 due to TCP's nature.

#### Benefits:
- **Faster Connections:** QUIC's 0-RTT and reduced connection establishment time lead to quicker load times.
- **Resilience to Network Changes:** QUIC connections are more robust against changes in network paths, reducing disruptions.
- **Built-in Encryption:** QUIC integrates TLS 1.3, ensuring that all HTTP/3 connections are encrypted by default, enhancing security.
